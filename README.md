# Technologically Progressive (TP)

Welcome to **Technologically Progressive (TP)**, a collection of innovative projects that blend data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. This repository is a growing resource of my explorations and implementations of various AI/ML techniques.

## Projects

### 1. BJP vs Congress Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets related to two major Indian political parties, the BJP and Congress. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project analyzes public opinion, identifies sentiment trends, and provides insights into political discourse.

### 2. Jio Plan Prediction
A data-driven project that uses machine learning algorithms to predict which Jio plans are most suitable for different customer segments. The model helps understand customer behavior and provides tailored recommendations.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
A deep dive into time series forecasting, where I analyze and predict trends over time. This project applies techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM to forecast future data points, making it useful in fields like finance, stock market predictions, and more.

## Future Work
I plan to expand this repository by adding more projects that focus on cutting-edge AI/ML advancements. Stay tuned for updates!
